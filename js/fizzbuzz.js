// Write a program that uses console.log to print
// all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
// For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number,
// and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
// For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
